PARTA: - Uses specular, ambient and diffuse lighting
       - Includes a standard vertex and fragment shader, shaders for the texture, skybox, and environment map. 
       - Has a torus which uses the reflecting material from cubeMap in the example code, has a sphere with a texture mapped onto it
         that also uses bufferGeometry to receive light, and also has a dinosaur that I modeled in Blender. Each of the objects rotates
PARTB: Move the mouse up and down to make the sun rise in the image. Uses the sharpen matrix. 
       Browser-specific: Works in Chrome
PARTC: contains several if statements and has a threshhold of .9
       changed the colors and added if statements to constrain the direction to be primarily vertical
PARTD: Evaluation of visual effects in The Walking Dead Game
